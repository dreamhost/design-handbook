Ah code review. Tedious and annoying code review. The design work is done. It *seems* to work. Push it live!

Code review is that last set of eyes on a designers work. See more in the Production Front-end Code section. There are a number of things that the reviewer should be looking out for. Code formatting and whitespace issues are the most tedious, but good code is consistent code. Grammar and typos are equally annoying but there isnâ€™t a formal copy review process yet, so this is the last line of defense for that.

Make sure any relevant tickets are linked to with Fixes or Refs in the commit message.
