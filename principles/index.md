<ul class="list">
	<li>Your browser / OS / device / resolution are not the only ones</li>
	<li>Not all mobile devices have mobile resolutions</li>
	<li>Write copy the way a user would explain it themselves</li>
	<li>Users should know when something is happening, and when it will be done</li>
	<li>Advanced users deserve shortcuts</li>
	<li>Users want to know when they reach the end. “Ok, now what?” is the enemy of good design.</li>
	<li>Users shouldn’t need to remember.</li>
	<li>Consistency (look, feel, tone, usability, design patterns) is 🔑 for users to feel confident. It directly reflects the quality of our service.</li>
	<li>Being descriptive does not require being verbose</li>
	<li>Intuitiveness > Simplicity</li>
	<li>Think about the edge cases. These are people too. Don’t neglect them.</li>
	<li>Figure out how the system works. Help design the system if possible. A polished UI tacked on to a system that doesn’t support it is bad design.</li>
	<li>Affordances are important. Make elements look clickable that are clickable, and don’t let elements look clickable that aren’t.</li>
	<li>Design is inclusive, not exclusive. Bring people in. Lead the team to design solutions.</li>
</ul>
