title: Design Principles
---

* Your browser / OS / device / resolution are not the only ones
* Not all mobile devices have mobile resolutions
* Write copy the way a user would explain it themselves
* Users should know when something is happening, and when it will be done
* Advanced users deserve shortcuts
* Users want to know when they reach the end. “Ok, now what?” is the enemy of good design.
* Users shouldn’t need to remember.
* Consistency (look, feel, tone, usability, design patterns) is 🔑 for users to feel confident. It directly reflects the quality of our service.
* Being descriptive does not require being verbose
* Intuitiveness > Simplicity
* Think about the edge cases. These are people too. Don’t neglect them.
* Figure out how the system works. Help design the system if possible. A polished UI tacked on to a system that doesn’t support it is bad design.
* Affordances are important. Make elements look clickable that are clickable, and don’t let elements look clickable that aren’t.
* Design is inclusive, not exclusive. Bring people in. Lead the team to design solutions.
